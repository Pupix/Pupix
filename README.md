## Hey, what's up?

I am Robert, a cutting edge tech enthusiast and a full stack developer that wears many hats, from grayscaled ones to cool af ones. I specialize in web and API development, cloud architectures and system integrations. Currently working at my own startup (as you do), [API FORGE](https://apiforge.it), where we help businesses move into the future through the process of digital transformation.

I've also been working on an IoT platform called [Beeno](https://beeno.it/contact). Why do things yourself when you can have a bunch of smart devices do everything while you take a nap?

In my spare time I like to crack open a cold one üç∫, and as many file formats and protocols as possible.

**Want to chit-chat?**

You can find me in [my discord server](https://discord.gg/HZ9fQeBeZS) all the damn time, on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-manolea/) for corporate and business stuff and all around the web [@pupix](https://www.google.com/search?q=%40pupix) or [@robertmanolea](https://www.google.com/search?q=%40robertmanolea) most likely.
