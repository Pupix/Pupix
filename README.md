## Hey, what's up?

I am Robert, a cutting edge tech enthusiast and a full stack developer that wears many hats, from white to black, and everything in between. I specialize in web and API development, cloud architectures, system integrations and IoT. Been developing [API FORGE](https://apiforge.it), a RESTful APIs factory for a few years. I've also been working on an IoT monitoring and analysis platform called [BEENO](https://beeno.it/contact). Why do things yourself when you can have a bunch of smart devices do everything while you take a nap? Lately I've been working on a sports platform with a companian app called [AF SPORTS](https://apiforge.it/sports), you can find it here for the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apiforge.sports) and [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/af-sports/id6736469217?platform=iphone).

In my spare time I like to crack open a cold one üç∫, and as many file formats and protocols as possible.

**Want to chit-chat?**

You can find me in [my discord server](https://discord.gg/HZ9fQeBeZS) all the damn time, on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-manolea/) for corporate and business stuff and all around the web [@pupix](https://www.google.com/search?q=%40pupix) or [@robertmanolea](https://www.google.com/search?q=%40robertmanolea) most likely.
